## Stenya Minecraft Network - Next-Generation Network

This is the developer organisation of the Stenya.net Minigames Network for the Sandbox game [Minecraft](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft). Here we publish a part of our APIs, Frameworks or other parts of software from our systems, to make it possible for everyone to have a look into parts of our source code. Examples are the [Text Component API](https://github.com/Stenya-Network/text-component-api) and the [Database Provider API](https://github.com/Stenya-Network/database-provider). Free feel to open issues, if you find bugs or something to improve the user experience.
